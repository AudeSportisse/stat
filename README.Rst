Imputation and estimation of low-rank matrices containing MNAR missing values 
=======

This repository hosts the code to impute and estimate low-rank matrices containing Missing Not At Random (MNAR) values. Different matrix completion methods are considered, including a model-based estimation strategy by modelling the missing mechanism distribution. More details are given in **[1]**.
